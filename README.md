# bioWebtree

This a web tools list for zhang lab used.

The web tree list consists of frequently used websites for genes. This tree contains three aspects of genes: **Genome, Protein and Fuction**.

This is just part of the summary. If you have more supplement websites that you want to add into bioWebtree. Please edit `README.md` file.
